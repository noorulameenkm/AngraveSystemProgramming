1. What is typedef?
    -> typedef is used to create aliases for a type, mostly used with structs, but we can use this
       for all the types
       ex:- 1. typedef float real (you can use real instead of floats)
            2. typedef struct node Node (you can use Node instead of struct node)
            3. typedef for a function
               ->   typedef int (*comparator)(void*,void*);
                    int greater_than(void* a, void* b){
                        return a > b;
                    }
                    comparator gt = greater_than;
