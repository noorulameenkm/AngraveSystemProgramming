1. Declaration
    -> You have to decalre a pointer like Type *var_name (ex:- int *ptr1)
2. Pointer Arithmetic
    -> You can add integer to the pointer, then that pointer will be moved that much bytes ahead
        (bytes in the sense if you are adding 2 to a char pointer then it will move exactly 2 bytes
         ahead, because char will take one byte, if it is int pointer, then it will move 2*byte of
         an int, mostly 2*4 bytes ahead)
3. Details
    -> Pointers are immutable, you can't change the values in the pointers(read only), you can
       change the values after making the pointer point to read-write memory 
       (ex:- point to an array)
4. Dangling pointer 
    -> Dangling pointers occur if we are assigning a value to a freed pointer 
       (assigning a value after freeing that pointer)
5. Double free error
    -> Trying to free a pointer that has already been freed, solution is to set pointer to NUll
        after freeing the memory
